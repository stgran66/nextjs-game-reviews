Indie Gamer is a project dedicated to showcasing game reviews for indie games. The primary goal of this project was to learn Next.js, a powerful framework for building modern web applications. We've utilized several technologies and libraries to create this platform, including Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Next.js:** Indie Gamer leverages Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. This choice offers a smooth development experience and ensures excellent performance out of the box.

- **React:** The foundation of our project's user interface is built with React. It enables the creation of dynamic and interactive components that enhance the user experience.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is our chosen styling framework. It follows a utility-first approach, streamlining development and maintaining a consistent design across the platform.
